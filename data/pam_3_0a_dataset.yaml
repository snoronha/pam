# Each element of the yaml list represents one column in the resulting dataframe
#
# name: the column name to use for the output Pandas dataframe
#
# lookup: the name to lookup in the anomaly dataframe, it should be included in
#         the right hand side of the anomaly_map.yaml file.
#
# type: the type of column, available options are:
#       - 'trigger': an anomaly occurance will create a new row in the dataset.
#                    For any given row, the value for this column will be the
#                    count of the occurances within hte window.
#       - 'flag': an anomaly occurance will NOT create a new row in the dataset.
#                 For any given row, the value for this column will be boolean
#                 based on the presence of this anomaly within hte window.
#       - 'background': an anomaly occurance will NOT create a new row in the
#                       dataset. For any given row, the value for this column
#                       will be the count of the occurances within hte window.
#       - 'cluster': the number of "groups" of anomalies in a window that are
#                    separated by at least an hour.
#       - 'special': this column type has hard-coded logic in the codebase.
#       - 'duration': the time since an event occurred (in years). The value
#                     of `lookup` should be in the feeder_df dataframe.
#       - 'constant': a cross-sectional numerical value. The value of `lookup`
#                     should be in the feeder_df dataframe.
#
# min_lag / max_lag : the window in hours. When a 'trigger' type anomaly occurs,
#                     a new row is created in the dataset. Then for each column
#                     the count or presence of each anomaly type is checked.
#                     Only specified for 'trigger', 'flag' and 'background'
#                     types. Optionally for 'special' column types if needed.
#
# keep_all : whether to drop duplicate anomalies occurring in the same minute.
